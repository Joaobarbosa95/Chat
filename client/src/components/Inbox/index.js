 *
 * 3rd -> Done
 *
 *  4th -> Use different sort algos on the onClick event in the select element target
 *
 *  5th -> if search input field is empty render all conversations, if not start filtering by the name being written: filter the available dialogues by name using a onChange event setting a setState inputValue
 *
 *  6th -> Create a form to add a username to the dialogues list
 *        -> Input on change method to sent the form data to the server
